JavaScript Drum Kit

This is the first project completed in the #JavaScript30 challenge.

I urilized the base HTML and CSS that was already created for the project.  I followed the video to write the JS.  After following the video, I created and recreated the JS multiple times to gain the fullest understanding of the code so that I could ultilize elements of this code in future.

All credit for this code is given to the folks at http://javascript30.com
